In this repository are the Python projects I have done for my CIS 211 class during the Spring 2020 term. The skeleton code was provided by the instructor along with most of the gui code, but the algorithyms and final connections were implemented by me.

There are 6 projects in total:
1) Calculator, lets you do integer calculations from the terminal prompt.
2) Duck sudoku solver, automaticaly solves sudoku with recursion.
3) Contagion, a version of "game of life" that simulates covid spread.
4) Agenda, which schedules appointments.
5) Five twelve, a version of the popular "2048" game.
6) Duck Machine, a fully fledged mini machine that reads binary instructions, assembles, compiles and uses cpu to calculate results of operations.

However, these programs will not work on their own, and are done only to be checked by a test file by the instructor.
All the source files were provided by my CIS 211 instructor from Spring 2020, Michal Young.
