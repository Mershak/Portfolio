In this repository are the Python and C projects I have done for my CIS classes. The skeleton code was provided by the instructor along with most of the gui code, but the algorithyms and final connections were implemented by me.

1) Calculator, lets you do integer calculations from the terminal prompt.
2) Duck sudoku solver, automaticaly solves sudoku with recursion.
3) Contagion, a version of "game of life" that simulates covid spread.
4) Agenda, which schedules appointments.
5) Five twelve, a version of the popular "2048" game.
6) Duck Machine, a fully fledged mini machine that reads binary instructions, assembles, compiles and uses cpu to calculate results of operations.
7) C Data Structures, a file with 2 data type implementations and a program that runs word frequency on the command line.
