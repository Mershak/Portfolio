In this repository are the projects I have done for my CIS 211 class during the Spring 2020 term. The skeleton code was provided by the instructor along with most of the gui code, but the algorithyms and final connections were implemented by me.

There are 6 projects in total:
1) Agenda, which schedules appointments.
2) Calculator, lets you do integer calculations from the terminal promt.
3) Duck sudoku solver, automatiicaly solves sudoku with recursion.
4) Contagion, a version of "game of life" that simulates covid spread.
5) Five twelve, a version of the popular "2048" game.
6) Duck Machine, a fully fledged mini machine that reads binary instructions, assembles, compiles and uses cpu to calculate results of operations.

All the source files were provided by my CIS 211 instructor from Spring 2020, Michal Young.
