There are 2 C Data Structure implementations and a word frequency counter completed by me for my coursework for CIS212 in the University of Oregon.

1) HashSet, a set data structure with bucket hashing.
2) llqueue, a queue data structure with linked list.
3) wordfreq, a command line program that takes file input and prints out word frequency.
